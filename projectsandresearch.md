<h3>Detecting Deceptive Hotel Reviews</h3>
This project is a re-implementation of the paper [Finding Deceptive Opinion Spam by Any Stretch of the Imagination](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P11-1032/). Here I developed machine learning models to classify honest and deceptive reviews for the top 20 hotels in Chicago. The hotel reviews were obtained from TripAdvisor.
- Dataset: The dataset consisted of 400 truthful and 400 deceptive hotel reviews.
- Algorithms used: Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes
- Encodings used: Uni-gram, Bi-gram, Tri-gram
- Technologies used: Python
- Libraries used: [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)

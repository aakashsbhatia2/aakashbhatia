I have spent 3 years as a Technology Risk consultant at EY LLP. During this time, I have worked with a number of clients, both local and international, to assess the risks involved in their technology processes. I have successfully developed applications to automate audit and testing procedures, conducted end-to-end Information Technology audits, critical infrastructure security assessments, application functionality reviews and technology risk gap assessments. Some of the highlights from my time at EY are as follows:
- I have developed automation tools which reduced effort by 75%.
- I coached and led a team of 6 to conduct a global engagement spread across 5 locations. We reviewed the I.T. General and Application Controls for a multinational Investment Bank. My team was awarded the EY Spotlight Award for exceptional quality delivered for this engagement.
